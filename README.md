# ASSIGNMENT 9 - MICROSERVICE INSTRUCTIONS

To programatically REQUEST data from the microservice, the program must print the word "run" into the receive.txt file. Any other text will generate no response from the microservice.

To programatically RECEIVE data from the microservice, the program must read in text from the sent.txt file AFTER sending a request. If no request was made, the microservice will not have been prompted and the sent.txt file will be blank, or have the previous paragraph inside. 

NOTE: The microservice will clear out the receive.txt file once it has printed into the sent.txt file, so the microservice will stop after printing one paragraph.
